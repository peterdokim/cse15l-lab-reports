# Lab-report-5-week-10

## 

### Choose any two tests from the 652 commonmark-spec tests where your implementation 
### had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9.

The tests with different answers should correspond to **different bugs** 

* How you found the tests with different results (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? 
* Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

For each test:
* Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
* For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the _bug (the problem in the code). 
* You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed.
