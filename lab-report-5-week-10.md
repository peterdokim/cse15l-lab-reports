# Lab-report-5-week-10

## 

### Choose any two tests from the 652 commonmark-spec tests where your implementation 
### had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9.

The tests with different answers should correspond to **different bugs** 

* How you found the tests with different results (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? 
* Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

For each test:
* Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
* For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the _bug (the problem in the code). 
* You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed.

On line 599 in results.txt there is difference, which corresponds to 342.md in the test files.




I believe that the implementation that the lab 9 Joe had for his ucsd-cse-15l-markdown-parse was the correct implementation.

On line 1027 in results.txt, there is a difference, which corresponds to 508.md in test-files.
