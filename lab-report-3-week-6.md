The -r option tells scp to work recursively. The . is the source, and is the current directory.</br>
The ~/markdown-parse tells scp to create the markdown-parse directory on the remote server (if it doesnâ€™t exist),</br> 
and then copy the contents of this directory recursively there.

2. logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository

  I logged into my ieng6 account

  Compile and run the test

This would run the test exactly like in our directory. so all our tests pass in this markdownparse test and markdownparse.java.

3. combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.

The copying logging into java is fine now, but the symbols are not recongnized as indicated by the diagram
